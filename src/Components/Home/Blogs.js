                        <p>Ans:React applications are built using components and they manage their state internally and it works well for applications with few components, but when the application grows bigger, the complexity of managing states shared across components becomes difficult..</p>

                        <h3 className="card-title">   3.Why you do not set the state directly in react ?</h3>
                        <p>Ans: To change a value in the state object, use the this. setState() method. When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s).</p>

                        <p> Ans: The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects.I understand, ‘this’ refers to itself, to its own object or global object. Using ‘this’ are partitioned in 3 locations of code. These are in functions, outside of functions (global scope, ex: window object), and in Javascript’s eval() function.Common pitfalls when using ‘this’ are usually relevant to scope issues in real functions, methods, and constructors. Though there are ways to fix these common issues by using ES5, bind() or ES6 arrow functions</p>

                        <p>Unit tests are typically automated tests written and run by software developers to ensure that a section of an application (known as the "unit") meets its design and behaves as intended. In procedural programming, a unit could be an entire module, but it is more commonly an individual function or procedure.</p>
